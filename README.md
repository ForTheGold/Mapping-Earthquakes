# Mapping-Earthquakes

Displaying earthquake and fault line data based upon an open API request.  The data is color and size coordinated and the dots are displayed on the location of the earthquake.

**Note: Use the index.html in the Earthquake_Challenge folder.

## Background

A data driven disaster relief network has reached out asking for some data on earthquakes.  The task is to build data visualizations with interactive features based on earthquakes around the world.   The work is going to be used by the earthquake response team which includes reporters and data visualization specialists.  They would like to make a site that can be accessed via web and mobile so that users can see disaster data easily.  This is in hopes to give a positive image to the organization.

## Results

The data is gathered and plotted on a Leaflet map using JavaScript.  There are four map type options to choose from including street, satellite street, light and dark as well as three types of data present on the map.  The data is collected from an API, size and color coded, and then displayed on the map.

The data that is shown include the largest earthquakes, all earthquakes and the fault lines.  Each of these data can be toggled on and off in the upper right hand corner of the page where you can also choose your map type.  A legend explaining the color scheme is displayed in the bottom corner.

Have a look at the following screenshots to see some examples of what can be seen on the site.
